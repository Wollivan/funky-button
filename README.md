# My kid's wanted a button...

We went to the zoo at Christmas, and there was a button to make some penguins sing.

Very cool.

But this meant every child wanted to press the button, so there was a queue of about 7 kids all waiting (2 minutes per child) each to start the next song.

So instead of watching singing anamatronic penguins for another 14 minutes, I said I'd make them a button.

I copied this: https://codepen.io/dudleystorey/pen/LYyrdO

BUT one of them wanted a green buttona and one wanted a red. So it changes every press. Everyone is happy!

Enjoy!
